# Inception
This project aims to broaden our knowledge of system administration by using Docker. we will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in our new personal virtual machine.

# What is Docker :

  * Docker is a container management service .

## What is a Container ?

 * A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing enviroment to another .
 * Containerization been around for a long time, but it was introduced in a diffrent way by Docker.
 * It packages applications as images that contain everything needed to run them : code, runtime environement , libraries, and configuration.
 * A Docker container image id a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application : code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

## Virtualization :

 * Virtualization is thechnology that lets you create useful IT services          using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. it allows to      use a physical machines full capacity by distributing its capabilities        among many users or environments.
