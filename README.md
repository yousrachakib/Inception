# Docker overview :
Docker is a platform that allows developers to package their applications and all of their dependencies into lightweight containers. These containers can then be easily shared and run consistently across different environments, from development to production. Think of it like a shipping container for software â€“ it encapsulates everything your application needs to run, such as code, libraries, and system tools. Docker simplifies the process of building, shipping, and running applications, making it easier to deploy software reliably and efficiently, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
